# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 

I am tasked with assisting Seth and Tom in completing the election audit. I will assist by fufilling the election commission's request for additional audit data. The additional results being requested are:

* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
